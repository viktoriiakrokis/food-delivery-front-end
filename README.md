## Getting started
Make sure you have installed NPM on your machine: [How to Install Node.js and NPM on a Mac](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac)

Install dependecies in the root directory of the project:
```
npm install
```

## Development Evironment
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and supports all the commands from the bootstrap.

Run the app in the development mode:
```
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode:
```
npm test
```

## Production Enviroment
Build the app for production to the `build` folder:
```
npm build
```
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
